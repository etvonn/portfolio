        <h1>Eli von Nordheim</h1>
        <p>Computer Engineer</p>
        <p>I am a computer engineering undergraduate at Iowa State University.
        I am studying embedded systems and hardware/software codesign.
        I have experience in Java, C, PCB design, and web development.

        I am also the assistant electrical director and battery protection system manager for the 
        university's solar car team, where I manage the overall function of the electrical subteam
        as well as my own project that monitors and manages a battery pack of ~1400 Lithium Ion Cells.

        <h3>PRISUM Solar Car: Battery Protection System</h3>
        <p>I have spent a year managing PRISUM Solar Car's battery protection system,
        which involves a group of sensor nodes that gather voltage and temperature data from
        a lithium ion battery pack, which are designed to report unacceptable voltage and temperature 
        measurements and ensure that all of the battery modules remain balanced. It also involves 
        It also includes a controller that is in charge of ensuring that the battey pack remains 
        disconnected until safe conditions are verified and disconnecting it when unsafe conditions are detected.

         <h3>NSF Undergraduate Research</h3>
        <p>I have spent this semester developing a PCB that would be used to monitor as well as emulate RF harvesting conditions for Dr. Duwe's Batteryless Intermittent Systems research group, which involves
            monitoring both gathering the harvesting conditions and being able to replay them for the boost converter as well as monitoring the load so that the output of the boost converter can be emulated for ease
            of programming and debugging.

        <h2>Ethics Essay</h2>
        <div class="project">
        
        <p>A code of ethics is a necessity in engineering, as there are often difficult, high impact
            decisions that engineers face where they may face pressure to act with a disregard for ethics. This
            code of ethics outlines how an engineer should act when facing this pressure, be it pressure to
            abandon the common good in the name of profit, pressure to participate in a violation of ethics, or
            any other sort of pressure to act in an unethical manner for one’s own benefit or even well-being.
            In my personal experience, much of the need for an ethical framework shows itself when a
            goal can only be achieved through a disregard for the common good or safety, and when I face
            these situations, often the only course of action is to evaluate the risks involved with the decision
            and be prepared to draw a line when common welfare is at risk. Ethical dilemmas are easy to find,
            as they generally involve disregarding honesty and integrity willingly, but the difficulty is not in
            finding them, it’s having the discipline to act against them despite pressure to do otherwise. The
            decision factor drawing me away from ethical decision making in that particular case is needing to
            be prepared to be the one who takes the blame for us not being able to reach our goals, even if it is
            the morally correct decision, which is something I’ve prepared to do, knowing I am in the position
            where I may be making difficult decisions.

            <br><br>
            The ethical issue I investigated was the Ford Pinto scandal, a case in which Ford ran a cost
            benefit analysis on the price of correcting a known safety issue vs the cost of simply allowing
            people to die due to the car’s flawed design, and determined that it would simply be less costly to
            allow people to die. Though a strict code of ethics isn’t necessary to see the ethical dilemma, a
            code of ethics would assist in resisting pressure to sacrifice the common good for the sake of profit.
            In the IEEE code of ethics, it not only violated code 1, which involves making decisions with the
            safety, health, and welfare of the public in mind, but also is an example of a company keeping
            secrets from the public as well as holding peers accountable for acting in a way that doesn’t align
            with the code of ethics. This was not the only case we discussed that followed this pattern of not
            only engineers disregarding public welfare for the sake of benefitting their company, but also
            nobody holding each other accountable. My group had no difficulty determining that in most of the
            articles, the ethical decision was not made, however, we were not jeopardizing our jobs in making
            that decision, so there was no incentive to act in an unethical manner.
            This dilemma and many of the others discuss from my own, primarily due to the fact that as
            early as I am in my career, I have not seen much profit-driven pressure to neglect the code of ethics.
            In my experience, working on competitive engineering student organizations, most of the pressure
            is to push deadlines in a way that stunts our ability to ensure team safety rather than to deliver an
            unsafe product because it is cheaper. It is very easy to make ethical decisions when you have no
            salary, because the pressure to make an unethical decision is very weak.

            <br><br>

            A number of the virtues of ethics were relevant to the Ford Pinto case study, the most
            relevant being integrity, honesty, and responsibility. These 3 are the most applicable because the
            majority of the moral dilemma surrounds a lack of integrity in choosing to put a known unsafe
            vehicle to market, being dishonest to the public by showing the vehicle was safe due to it
            technically meeting the contemporary safety laws, as well as responsibility for the lack of
            accountability from those who decided to allow the unsafe vehicle to be put to market. The other
            virtues, though one could argue that they still apply, virtues like fidelity and charity can be
            tangentially applied more so than they can directly. Though there was a lack of compassion for your
            fellow man, it was less of an issue of not being charitable than it was a disregard of moral principle
            knowingly disregarding the wellbeing of the public. In the case of fidelity, the faithfulness in the
            engineer’s employer was present and arguably misplaced, as they were already disregarding ethics.
            There are also virtues that aren’t listed, such as peer-accountability, that can not only help prevent
            neglecting ethical codes by creating pressure to focus on ethics, but also to protect individual
            engineers from pressure from above by giving engineers the ability to leverage their common ethical
            framework to resist pressure from above to disregard ethics for the sake of profit as a group as
            opposed to as individuals.

            <br><br>

            The key to maintaining an ethical framework is having a common understanding of it and
            knowing its value, both of which are conducive to peer accountability in upholding the ethical
            principles that govern the way engineers should make moral decisions. Understanding the value of
            honesty and integrity prevents future ethically bankrupt decisions from harming the public and
            creating distrust with engineers.

        <h1>Eli von Nordheim</h1>
        <p>eliv@iastate.edu</p>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! I am a computer engineering undergraduate at Iowa State University looking to begin my career in hardware design, be it for PCBs, integrated circuits, or larger electrical systems.
            <h2>Career Objectives</h2>
        Long term, I want to work in hardware design for either product development or testing, both of which I have experienced and enjoyed. I want to work in a role where I can see the impact of my own work, even if it is just a piece of a larger system. I would also like to continue to learn and grow as an engineer, both in my own technical capabilities as well as as a team member.

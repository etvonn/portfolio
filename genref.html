        <p>Though they may not be the first courses that come to mind when thinking about developing engineering skills, my general education courses at Iowa State have offered valuable insights that helped me develop professionally, even if they haven’t necessarily advanced my technical skills. These courses offer a broadened perspective that helps me understand not only the systemic impacts of innovation but also gives me additional insight into different cultures, political systems, and overall global contexts. 

            <br><br>
            An example of seeing systemic impacts of innovation was Architecture 321: History of the American City, which explored not only historic architecture and how it was shaped by innovation, but also how these innovations reshaped segregation and inequality in America. For example, the innovation and popularization of cars. Though we generally look back on it as a positive innovation, enabling us to travel longer distances faster, improving people’s long-distance mobility as well as advancing shipping and overall improving the connection between cities across the country, however, the course looked at some of the negative societal effects. Exploring topics such as the car, which caused the wealthier, generally white, families to move away from the city, causing the underfunded urban centers that we see today. 
            <br><br>

            As far as global awareness, my Political Science 125 introduction to comparative politics offered a substantial amount of global perspective. By building this global awareness, I can collaborate more effectively with international teams as well as understand how decisions are made in different governance systems. By learned about the causes and functions of democracy and dictatorship, as well as the economic and social policies that are often paired with them, such as regulatory or logistical challenges. Though this doesn’t necessarily enhance my technical skills, my increased understanding of how globally different cultures may prioritize different things, as well as understanding some of the cultural or political context of innovation, makes me a better engineer and teammate. 

            <br><br>

            General education courses may not appear to be inherently connected to engineering, but they helped me become a more well-rounded engineer. These courses developed my broader understanding of the world and how innovation affects the world around me. Though they didn’t advance my technical skills, they strengthened my ability to consider the broader consequences and context of my work. The enhanced understanding of the world around me that I derived from my general education courses made me the engineer I am today, allowing me to not only solve engineering problems but also to do so with social responsibility and empathy.

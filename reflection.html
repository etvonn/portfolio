        <p>	Looking back on my time at Iowa State, I don’t see a series of courses and assessments to test my engineering skills, but rather a variety of experiences that shaped the engineer I am today. Whether it be a strenuous course project, working as a team with a student organization, or getting my hands on industry engineering work as an intern, development was not limited to only getting technical skills and moving on, it also determined who I am as a problem solver and teammate. 

            <br><br>
            The start of my out-of-class learning at Iowa State began my freshman year as a part of the solar car team where I started to develop my hardware design skills and work as a large team for the first time. Throughout the course of my first semester, I worked under a technical manager to help develop the battery protection system with the mentorship of the team’s leadership. By the end of that semester, as my manager began to have his time taken up by his senior year courses, I took over management of the project, working with a team of my own to design the hardware throughout the battery pack. Through this role, I learned a lot about leading a team, and was eventually appointed as assistant electrical director, granting me not only the early opportunity to become the mentor that the team leadership was for me, but also preparing me for future EE courses and senior design. With these early lessons, I took my skills to my first internship where I worked with John Deere to develop their battery management system and advance their electrification efforts.

            <br><br>
            As I moved forward into my more complex courses, I had a newfound interest in digital microelectronics, learning the basics of digital logic and gradually moving into high-level computer architecture, especially through the pipelined MIPS processor that I designed in CPRE 3810. The opportunity to deep dive into the design and functionality of a processor through RTL design opened a new door for me, as I had never even understood what went into digital microelectronics before then, and now, it was something I was chasing after. 

            <br><br>
            With this newfound interest in microelectronics, my mentors from solar car drew me into ChipForge, a student organization they invited me to be an initial leader of, giving me a chance to use the leadership skills that I developed with solar car and combine them with my new technical interests to provide students with an opportunity to have their digital logic and computer architecture designs fabricated on a multi-project chip as well as support them in learning how to design for fabrication rather than FPGAs. 
            <br><br>
            Following my junior year, I began my second internship, this time with ForwardEdge ASIC, where I not only continued my professional development with a new team, but also approached engineering from yet another angle, this time through testing, which I grew to enjoy through developing my skills with my mentors. Though I still borrowed skills from my past experiences and coursework, testing allowed me to use my skills from a new perspective and continue to learn not just the skills themselves, but how to use them and their value. 
            <br><br>
            All of these experiences lead to today, where I continue to use these skills and develop new ones through senior design, term projects, and continued mentorship from those around me, continuing to do so as time goes on and going into my career as I already have through my various experiences at Iowa State.
